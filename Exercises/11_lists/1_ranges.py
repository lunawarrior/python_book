# What is the Python interpreterâ€™s response to the following?

# The three arguments to the range function are start, stop, and step, respectively. 
# In this example, start is greater than stop. (Like the commented line) What happens if start < stop and step < 0? 
# Write a rule for the relationships among start, stop, and step.
