# Lists can be used to represent mathematical vectors. 
# In this exercise and several that follow you will write functions to perform standard operations on vectors. 
# Create a script named vectors.py and write Python code to pass the tests in each case.

# Write a function add_vectors(u, v) that takes two lists of numbers of the same length,
# and returns a new list containing the sums of the corresponding elements of each:
import test






test(add_vectors([1, 1], [1, 1]), [2, 2])
test(add_vectors([1, 2], [1, 4]), [2, 6])
test(add_vectors([1, 2, 1], [1, 4, 3]), [2, 6, 4])
