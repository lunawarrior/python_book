This is the first exercise in chapter 8

What is the result of each of the following?

For each line examine the code and predict what the output will be.  Then modify that line to print out the result

print("Python"[1])
print("Strings are sequences of characters."[5])
print(len("wonderful"))
print("Mystery"[:4])
"p" in "Pineapple"
"apple" in "Pineapple"
"pear" not in "Pineapple"
"apple" > "pineapple"
"pineapple" < "Peach"
