# Before this we were using "Procedural Programming".  
# Focuses is on writing functions or procedures which operate on data.

# Now we will be starting "Object Oriented Programming". 
# is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together. 
# (We have seen turtle objects, string objects, and random number generators)

# See "point.py" for an example of a class with an "initializer method"
