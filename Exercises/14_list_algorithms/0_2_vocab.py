#Here is a more realistic problem.

# As children learn to read, there are expectations that their vocabulary will grow. 
# So a child of age 14 is expected to know more words than a child of age 8. 
# When prescribing reading books for a grade, an important question might be 
#   "which words in this book are not in the expected vocabulary at this level?‚Äù
#
# Let us assume we can read a vocabulary of words into our program, and read the text of a book, 
# and split it into words. Let us write some tests for what we need to do next. 
# 
# Test data can usually be very small, even if we intend to finally use our program for 
# larger cases:

# I have provided a version of the search_linear from the last problem
